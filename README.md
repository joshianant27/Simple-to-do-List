# Simple-to-do-List
Just a simple fun project I did to teach myself some Javascript. This is a basic to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and styling for a clean and functional user interface.

## <br>Features</br>
<br>Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.</br>
<br>Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.</br>
<br>Responsive Design: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.</br>
